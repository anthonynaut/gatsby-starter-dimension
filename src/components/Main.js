            My interests in Technology have always been there ever since I was a child (video games!).
            But I really got interested in my High School years wondering how the things around me worked.
            So I joined the Robotics team! I did great and got all A's but, it wasn't my gig. I became increasingly
            interested with the computer softwares that I would use to build 3d models of the robots that I want to bring to life (I also took Greentech
            classes and got Outstanding grade in it too! We used a similar 3d modeling software where one can create their 
            very own city! So cool!). I had little knowlegde on how things operated a computer. Therefore leading me to want to expand my knowlegde in it without having
            to take out my music classes and other electives. Sadly, I graduated without having the chance to get computer science classes on my transcript.
            Right out of High School I wasn't sure what I was going to do. Until my older brother reached out to me 
            about this really cool website called code cademy where I can learn to code <b>FOR FREE. </b>
             So, I gave it a shot, and fell in love with the craft instantly. I started to code for fun and do tutorials online to see what I can manage. 
            Soon enough, it started to become me coding my own projects and I decided that I Wanted to level up in life.
            Now knowing that I was set on this path I had to figure out how I was going to do this.
            I started doing extensive researching and ended up with Three options: Self Learning, College, and Coding Bootcamp.
            I tried the self learning route and it is tough because there is no guide to aid you in any direction.
            Then I considered College for a while but became dissapointed with numbers that these colleges were asking for.
            I knew I couldn't afford that, and needed to focus my attention on only coding. So I did my research for coding bootcamps
            and found Coding Temple! I immediately told my older brother about them and he was on board so much so that He offered to pay for the bootcamp in Full if I promised to pay him when I'm on my feet! I went all in 
            and went through hell and back to graduate the program (it was so much harder than I thought. Coding Bootcamps is like 4 years of college into 3 months. At least in my case it was 3months in length. Crazy!).
            I came out the other side with skills I could have only dreamt of just a few months ago! I really learned a lot about myself
            and was shocked that I was able to absorb so much so quickly then.
            I'm now actively seeking to contribute to something bigger than myself with me and my skillset to offer.
